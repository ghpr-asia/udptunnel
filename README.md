## Grasshopper README.md
Code on `master` branch is open-sourced. However we are not open-sourcing `scripts/` directory since it's not related to `udptunnel` - thus keeping it in a dedicated directory.

## Original README.md note
UDPTunnel by Jonathan Lennox; copyright 1999,2001 by Columbia University.

UDPTunnel is a small program which can tunnel UDP packets bi-directionally
over a TCP connection.  Its primary purpose (and original motivation) is to
allow multi-media conferences to traverse a firewall which allows only
outgoing TCP connections.

Source code for Unix is available from
<ftp://ftp.cs.columbia.edu/pub/lennox/udptunnel/>.

See udptunnel.html for installation and usage instructions.  See COPYRIGHT
for conditions and terms of redistribution.  A current version of
udptunnel.html is located at
